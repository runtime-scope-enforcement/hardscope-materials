RISC-V toolchain
================

This directory contains the RISC-V toolchain and patches.
In these instructions riscv-tools is the name of directory that contains
sources for RISC-V tools. riscv-install is the installation destination
directory.

Preparation
-----------

Script `toolsprep.sh` will clone RISC-V tools repository, and its submodules
from GitHub, checkout to the right commit and apply the patches for Xscen
extension support.  After successful execution the source files are in
riscv-tools directory.
Following packages are required on Ubuntu to build RISC-V toolchain:

autoconf automake autotools-dev curl device-tree-compiler libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev
libgmp-dev gawk build-essential bison flex texinfo gperf libtool patchutils bc
zlib1g-dev

Requirements for other systems may be different. Refer to RISC-V toolchain
documentation for more information.

```
./toolsprep.sh
```

Building
--------

After preparations, you can build the toolchain following the standard procedure
by setting the RISCV environment variable to install destination directory of your
choice, `/home/user/riscv-install` in this example, and running `build-rv32ima.sh`
in riscv-tools directory.

```
cd riscv-tools
export RISCV=/home/user/riscv-install
./build-rv32ima.sh
```

Usage
-----

Add `$RISCV/bin` to your PATH environment variable and make sure that the tools
are available by running `which riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc`.  Now you can compile C
programs for RISC-V with `riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc` and run them with
`spike pk a.out`.

```
export PATH=$PATH:/home/user/riscv-install/bin
which riscv32-unknown-elf-gcc
cd ../dopserv
make
spike dopserv.noio.bare.wlibc.xscen
```
